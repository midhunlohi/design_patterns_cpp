# adapter design pattern

The adapter pattern is a software design pattern ( Also called as wrapper ) that allows the interface
of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classess work
with other classess without modifying their source code.

# definition

An adapter allows two incompatible interfaces to work together. This is the real-world definition for
an adapter. Interfaces may be incombatible, but the inner functionality should suit the need.
The adapter design pattern allows otherwise incompatible classes to work together by converting
the interface of one class into an interface expected by the clients.

# Real world applications

1) SD Card Reader
2) Laptop charger
